# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the Web Matters [code of conduct](http://www.web-matters.co.uk/code-of-conduct.html).

## Process

The site is run by GitHub from `master` so do not directly commit to `master`.

We operate a two phase commit policy so all code should be reviewed before being merged.

Make your changes in a branch or a fork and open a pull request.  Once this has been reviewed and approved it can be merged into `master`.
